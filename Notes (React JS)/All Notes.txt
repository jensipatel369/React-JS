Library and Frame work difference :-
-> Library and frame work both provide pre-return code and functionality's but frame work is fully independent but library is not.

...React JS...

React JS :-
-> React is a JavaScript library. Maintain and develop by facebook. Use to create single page application and provide us reach user interface (UI).

Features React JS :-
-> Components
-> virtual DOM
-> JSX (JavaScript XML)
-> One-Way Data Binding (One-way data flow)

React JS project run Commands :-
1. npm create vite
2. npm i
3. npm dev


...Full Form...

SWC :- Speedy Web Compiler  
npm :- Node package manager
npx :- Node Package eXecute
jsx :- JavaScript XML


...Module...

Module :- These are user define files or block of code which we can import and export.


...JSX...

JSX :- JavaScript XML it allows us to write HTML with JavaScript together. Represent by {}.


...Component...

Component :- Component is a re-usable piece of code returns a part of UI.
-> There are 2 (two) type of component :-
   1. Functional Base Component :- When we write a simple JavaScript function in a component and it return some value.
   2. Class Base Component :- When we write ES6 classes (oops) in a component.

-> Function mate :- rfc - React Function Component
-> Class mate :- rcc - React Class Component



.... Class Component .... 

-> Class components have all the features of react JS like state, props, life cycle methods and all but functional components does not have those initially.

-> Class Component Features :-
   1. state
   2. Props
   3. Life Cycle

-> In react 16.8 hooks were introduced which provide all the features of react in functional components.

1.Life cycle:-
  -> There are three life cycle stages :-  
    1. Mounting :- Creation of a components
    2. Updating :- Updation of a components
    3. Unmounting :- Completion of a components

  -> Life cycle Methods in Class Components :-
    1.componentDidMount()
    2.componentDidUppdate()
    3.componentWillUnmount()

  -> Life cycle method in functional components there is a hook called useEffect()

2. State :- 
-> In React, "state" refers to a JavaScript object that holds data specific to a component, which can change over time and influence the component's rendering. 
-> state (this.state) Target

3. Props :-
-> Props stands for properties used to pass data from parent to child component. This is a fundamental concept of react JS.



...Hooks...

Hooks :- Hooks in React are functions that allow you to "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from functional components. Introduced in React 16.8, they enable the use of state, side effects, and other React features without the need for class components. 

1. useState :-  The useState Hook in React allows functional components to manage and track state, which refers to data or properties that can change over time within an application.

2. useEffect :- 
-> This is a important hook used to perform side effects in functional components like data fetching and API calling.
-> We can also perform life cycle methods in functional components using useEffect hook.

3. useRef :- This is a hook used to create mutable reference with DOM elements and it does not cause re-render. 


...Key...

Key :- Keys are special string attributes that you must include when creating lists of elements in React. They help React efficiently identify which items  in a list have changed, been added, or been removed.


...Fragments...

Fragments :- React Fragments are a feature in React that allow you to group multiple elements returned by a component's render method without adding an extra node to the DOM.
	

...Controlled or Uncontrolled Components...

Controlled :- In Controlled Components the form data is handled by react state or developer.

Uncontrolled :- In Uncontrolled components the form data is handle by DOM itself using hooks like useRef.


...HOC...

Higher-Order Components :-  A Higher-Order Component (HOC) in React is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component with enhanced functionality or modified behavior. It is a pattern for reusing component logic and achieving separation of concerns.


...Routing...

Routing in React.js refers to the process of navigation between different views or components within a single-page application (SPA) without requiring a full page reload.


....React-router-dom Hook...

1. useNavigate()
2. useLocation()
3. useParams()


...useLocation...

useLocation is a hook provided by react-router-dom used to access location object.


...REST...

Rest :- Representational State Transfer



...JSON Server commands...

npx json-server --port 5000 --watch db.json



... State Management...

1. Single component state management -> useState()
2. Two component state management -> Props -> Props Drilling (The problem)
3. Managing state in whole component tree -> Context API -> Limitation of components tree (The problem)
-> Three(03) Steps Context API :-
   1. Create Context
   2. Provide Context
   3. Consume Context
4. Managing state globaly -> Redux


...Hooks...

1. useContext -> useContext is a hook. This consume a context value.

2. useMemo() :- useMemo is a React Hook that optimizes performance by memoizing (caching) the result of a calculation between re-renders. It prevents expensive computations from being re-executed unnecessarily when a component re-renders.

3. useCallback() :- The useCallback hook in React is used to memoize callback functions, preventing their re-creation on every render unless their dependencies change. This optimization is particularly beneficial when passing functions as props to child components, especially those wrapped with React.memo, to avoid unnecessary re-renders of the child.


...Redux...

Definition of Redux :- Redux is a JavaScript library for predictable state management, commonly used with React to manage application-wide state. It provides a centralized store for your application's state, enabling a consistent and debuggable way to manage data flow.

Key Concepts of Redux in React :-

1. Store :- The central place where the entire application state resides.
2. Actions :- Plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened. They have a type property and optionally a payload containing data.
3. Reducers :- Pure functions that take the current state and an action, then return a new state. They specify how the application's state changes in response to actions.
4. Dispatch :- The method used to send actions to the store, triggering state updates through reducers.

-> Slice Redux :- A slice refers to a self-contained piece of state and its corresponding reducer logic and actions for a specific feature.


...useReducer...

-> useReducer is a hook used to handle complex state logic alternative to useState. It follows a similar pattern to redux.


...Extra Reducer...

-> Extra Reducer is an additional reducer that change the current slice state on another slice action.
